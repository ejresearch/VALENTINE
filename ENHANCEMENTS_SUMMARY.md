# Valentine Enhancements Summary

Based on the annotated screenplay formatting examples, Valentine has been enhanced with four major new features to handle real-world "messy" screenplays.

## âœ… Completed Enhancements

### 1. New Validation Rules (validator.py)

Added 5 new error codes to detect real-world formatting issues:

| Error Code | Issue Detected | Example |
|------------|----------------|---------|
| **E9** | Meta-comments | `[NOTE TO SELF: shoot wide?]` |
| **E10** | Casual text | `idk`, `lol`, `btw` in dialogue |
| **E11** | Character inconsistency | `Jess` vs `JESSICA` vs `jess` |
| **E12** | Redundant content | Repeated dialogue or action lines |
| **E13** | Misplaced action in parentheticals | `(long stare . . . . too long)` |

#### Implementation Details:

**Meta-Comments Detection** (`_validate_meta_comments`):
- Detects: `[NOTE]`, `[TODO]`, `[FIXME]`, `[DECIDE]`, `[MAYBE]`, `[TBD]`, etc.
- Provides cleaned suggestion with comments removed
- Confidence: 0.95 (very high - safe to auto-apply)

**Casual Text Detection** (`_validate_casual_text`):
- Expands abbreviations: `idk` â†’ `I don't know`, `btw` â†’ `by the way`
- Handles: `lol`, `omg`, `wtf`, `brb`, `fyi`, `imo`, `imho`
- Confidence: 0.85

**Character Consistency** (`_validate_character_consistency`):
- Detects variations: `JESS` vs `Jess` vs `jess`
- Identifies related names: `JESS` and `JESSICA`, `MIKE` and `MICHAEL`
- Suggests canonical ALL CAPS form
- Confidence: 0.90 for direct variants, 0.60 for possible relations

**Redundancy Detection** (`_validate_redundant_content`):
- Tracks dialogue and action lines across screenplay
- Flags exact duplicates (normalized)
- Minimum length: 20 chars for dialogue, 30 for action
- Confidence: 0.70 (review recommended, may be intentional)

**Misplaced Action in Parentheticals** (`_validate_misplaced_action_in_parentheticals`):
- Detects action verbs: walks, runs, sits, enters, staring, etc.
- Flags long parentheticals (>50 characters)
- Suggests moving to action line
- Confidence: 0.75-0.80

### 2. Enhanced AI Correction Prompts (llm_corrector.py)

Updated the LLM correction prompts with **7 annotated examples** showing before/after transformations:

#### Examples Added to Prompt:

1. **Scene Headings**:
   ```
   BAD: int.  coffee shop  â€“DAY     #SCENE_1
   GOOD: INT. COFFEE SHOP â€“ DAY
   ```

2. **Meta-Comments**:
   ```
   BAD: [NOTE TO SELF: shoot wide? or ultra-tight? decide later]
   GOOD: [Remove entirely]
   ```

3. **Character Names**:
   ```
   BAD: Jess, JESSICA, jess (inconsistent)
   GOOD: JESS (unified to one canonical form)
   ```

4. **Casual Text**:
   ```
   BAD: idk, lol, shh sh shhhh
   GOOD: I don't know, (laughing), (shushing)
   ```

5. **Extensions**:
   ```
   BAD: (o.s.), (V.O), (CONT'D)
   GOOD: (O.S.), (V.O.), (CONT'D)
   ```

6. **Parentheticals**:
   ```
   BAD: (long stare . . . . too long)
   GOOD: [Move to action] She stares for a long moment.
   ```

7. **Redundancy**:
   ```
   BAD: Repeated identical dialogue
   GOOD: Flag for review (may be intentional)
   ```

#### Prompt Improvements:
- Explicit instructions for each common issue
- Clear BAD vs GOOD examples
- Emphasis on character name consistency
- Meta-comment removal instructions
- Parenthetical usage guidelines (tone only, not action)

---

### 3. Character Name Unification Feature (character_unifier.py)

New standalone utility class for unifying character name variations.

#### Features:
- **Automatic Detection**: Finds all character name variants
- **Related Name Matching**: Detects `JESS`/`JESSICA`, `MIKE`/`MICHAEL`
- **Canonical Form Selection**: Prefers longest name, all-caps version
- **Extension Preservation**: Maintains `(O.S.)`, `(V.O.)`, `(CONT'D)`
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows all variants and occurrences

#### Usage:
```python
from screenplay_formatter.character_unifier import CharacterNameUnifier

unifier = CharacterNameUnifier()
unifier.analyze_characters(elements)

# Get report
print(unifier.get_unification_report())

# Apply unification
unified_elements = unifier.unify_characters(elements)

# Check for inconsistencies only
inconsistent = unifier.get_inconsistent_characters()
```

#### Example Output:
```
Character Name Unification Report
==================================================

Character: JESS
  Occurrences: 15
  Variants found: JESS, Jess, jess, JESSICA
  â†’ Will unify to: JESSICA

Character: MIKE
  Occurrences: 8
  Variants found: MIKE, Mike, MICHAEL
  â†’ Will unify to: MICHAEL
```

### 4. Meta-Comment Detection and Removal (meta_comment_remover.py)

New standalone utility for removing production notes and meta-comments.

#### Features:
- **Comprehensive Pattern Matching**:
  - Bracketed comments: `[NOTE TO SELF]`, `[TODO]`, `[FIXME]`
  - Parenthetical comments: `(NOTE: something)`
  - Inline comments: `//`, `#`
- **False Positive Detection**: Preserves valid screenplay elements
- **Content Cleaning**: Removes extra whitespace after removal
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows what was removed and from where
- **Preview Mode**: Check what would be removed without modifying

#### Usage:
```python
from screenplay_formatter.meta_comment_remover import MetaCommentRemover

remover = MetaCommentRemover()

# Preview what would be removed
preview = remover.preview_removal(elements)
print(f"Would remove {len(preview)} comments")

# Remove meta-comments
cleaned_elements = remover.remove_meta_comments(elements)

# Get report
print(remover.get_removal_report())
```

#### Example Output:
```
Meta-Comment Removal Report
============================================================
Total meta-comments removed: 3

ACTION: 2 comments removed
DIALOGUE: 1 comments removed

Detailed Removals:
------------------------------------------------------------
Line 3 (ACTION):
  Removed: [NOTE TO SELF: shoot wide? or ultra-tight? decide later]
  Before: A BARISTA PULLS A SHOT [NOTE TO SELF: shoot wide?...]
  After:  A BARISTA pulls a shot for an empty chair.
```

## Integration with Existing Features

### How These Enhancements Work Together:

1. **Validation Phase** (validator.py):
   - Detects 13 error types (8 original + 5 new)
   - Provides specific error codes for LLM targeting

2. **Pre-Processing** (optional):
   - Character name unification: Clean up character variants before validation
   - Meta-comment removal: Strip production notes before formatting

3. **AI Correction Phase** (llm_corrector.py):
   - Enhanced prompts with annotated examples
   - Targets specific error codes detected in validation
   - Uses real-world before/after patterns

4. **Post-Processing** (formatter.py):
   - Formats clean, validated screenplay
   - Applies industry-standard layout
   - Exports to TXT, DOCX, or PDF

---

## Testing Results

Using the test file `test_messy_screenplay.txt`:

### Validation Detected:
- âœ… 1 invalid scene heading (E1)
- âœ… 2 meta-comments (E9)
- âœ… 1 casual text instance (E10)

### Character Unification Found:
- Variants of JESS/JESSICA
- Variants of MIKE/MICHAEL/mike
- Suggested canonical forms

### Meta-Comments Found:
- `[NOTE TO SELF: shoot wide? or ultra-tight? decide later]`
- `[TODO: rework this dialogue]`

## Web Interface Integration

All new features are accessible through the existing web interface:

1. **Standard Format** mode: Uses enhanced validation
2. **AI-Powered Fix** mode: Uses enhanced prompts with new error detection
