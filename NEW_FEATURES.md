```

### 3. VFX/SFX Bracketed Text Support ‚≠ê MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**What it does:**
- Recognizes sound effects and visual effects in brackets
- Formats as action lines but preserves brackets
- Uppercase formatting for emphasis

**Usage:**

[EXPLOSION]
[CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT]
[PHONE RINGING]
[LIGHTNING FLASH]
```

**Output:** Formatted as uppercase action lines with brackets intact

---

### 4. Scene Numbering for Shooting Scripts ‚≠ê HIGH PRIORITY
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**What it does:**
- Adds sequential scene numbers to all scene headings
- Numbers appear on both left and right sides (industry standard)
- Essential for production/shooting scripts

**Usage:**

screenplay-format format input.txt output.pdf --scene-numbers

screenplay-format format input.txt output.pdf -s
```

**Output:**
```
1   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY   1

Sarah enters.

2   EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS   2

She hails a taxi.
```

**Supported in:** Text, DOCX, PDF formats

---

## üöß Partially Implemented

### 5. Automatic MORE/CONT'D Insertion
**Status:** üöß Planned (infrastructure in place)

**What it would do:**
- Automatically add (MORE) at end of page when dialogue continues
- Add (CONT'D) to character name on next page
- Currently: parser recognizes (CONT'D), but doesn't auto-insert

**Why not completed:**
- Requires complex pagination tracking across formatters
- Different page length calculations for text vs PDF vs DOCX
- Would need reflow logic to handle dialogue splitting

**Current workaround:** Manually add (CONT'D) to character names

---

### 6. Improved Dual Dialogue Layout
**Status:** üöß Functional but basic

**Current implementation:**
- Parser recognizes `^` prefix for second character
- Basic side-by-side detection
- Not true two-column layout in all formats

**What's needed for perfection:**
- True two-column rendering in PDF
- Better side-by-side alignment in text format
- Proper column width calculations

**Current workaround:** Use `^CHARACTER` syntax - works but not perfectly aligned
