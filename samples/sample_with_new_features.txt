FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy neighborhood coffee shop bustles with morning activity. SARAH (30s, wearing a red jacket) enters through the glass door.

[BELL CHIMES]

CLOSE ON: Sarah's face as she scans the room.

SARAH
(to herself)
Perfect spot.

She approaches the counter where JAKE (20s, barista) is wiping down the espresso machine.

JAKE
Morning! The usual?

SARAH
You know it. Extra shot today.

JAKE
Rough night?

SARAH
You have no idea. My screenplay is due tomorrow and I'm still on page forty.

JAKE
(sympathetic)
That's tough. Coffee coming right up.

Jake turns to make her drink.

[ESPRESSO MACHINE HISSING]

Sarah pulls out her laptop and sits at a corner table.

WIPE TO:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - LATER

Sarah types furiously. Her coffee cup is empty. Jake refills it without her asking.

SARAH
(without looking up)
You're a lifesaver.

^PATRON AT NEXT TABLE
(simultaneously)
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

SARAH
It's all yours.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

Sarah rushes out of the coffee shop, laptop bag slung over her shoulder. A taxi pulls up.

SUPER: THREE HOURS UNTIL DEADLINE

She jumps in the taxi.

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Sarah frantically types on her laptop as the DRIVER navigates through traffic.

DRIVER (V.O.)
Where to, miss?

SARAH
(not looking up)
Production office on Vine Street. And please hurry!

IRIS OUT.

THE END
