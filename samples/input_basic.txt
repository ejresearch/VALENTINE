FADE IN:

INT. DETECTIVE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A dimly lit office filled with case files and old photographs. DETECTIVE MORGAN (40s, weathered face) sits at his desk, studying a photograph under a desk lamp.

DETECTIVE MORGAN
(to himself)
Something doesn't add up.

The door bursts open. OFFICER CHEN (30s, uniform) rushes in.

OFFICER CHEN
Detective! We found something!

DETECTIVE MORGAN
(standing)
What is it?

OFFICER CHEN
The witness from the park...
(beat)
She remembers seeing a blue sedan.

Detective Morgan grabs his coat.

DETECTIVE MORGAN
Let's go.

CUT TO:

Police cars surround the area. Yellow tape blocks off a section near the pond.

Every case has that one moment when everything clicks.
