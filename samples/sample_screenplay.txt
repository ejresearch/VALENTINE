FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy neighborhood coffee shop buzzing with morning activity. Sunlight streams through large windows. SARAH (30s, professional attire) enters, scanning the crowded space.

She spots an empty table by the window and hurries over.

SARAH
(to herself)
Perfect.

She sets down her laptop bag and approaches the counter where JAKE (20s, barista apron) greets her with a smile.

JAKE
Morning! The usual?

SARAH
(smiling)
You know me too well. Large coffee, black.

JAKE
Coming right up!

Jake turns to prepare the coffee. Sarah glances at her watch, concerned.

SARAH
(urgent)
Actually, could you make that to go? I just remembered I have a meeting.

JAKE
(over his shoulder)
No problem!

He hands her the coffee in a to-go cup.

JAKE (CONT'D)
That'll be $3.50.

Sarah pays and rushes toward the door.

SARAH
Thanks, Jake! See you tomorrow!

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

Sarah emerges from the coffee shop, coffee in hand, and hails a taxi.

FADE OUT.
