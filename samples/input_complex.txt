TITLE: Three Years Earlier

INT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY

Rows of ancient books line towering shelves. PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE (50s, tweed jacket, wire-rim glasses) pulls a leather-bound volume from a high shelf.

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
(excited)
This is it!

His assistant, EMMA (20s, grad student) looks up from her laptop.

EMMA
Professor?

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
The missing manuscript! The one referenced in the Cairo papers!
(flipping pages)
Look at these symbols...

EMMA
(approaching)
They're similar to the ones we found in Greece.

CHYRON: ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY OF THE CENTURY

Professor Hawthorne's phone RINGS. He answers.

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
(into phone)
Hawthorne.
(listening)
Yes... I understand... We'll be there.

He hangs up, troubled.

EMMA
What's wrong?

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
(serious)
The ministry wants to see us. Now.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A sterile room with a long table. DIRECTOR SMITH (60s, severe suit) sits at the head.

DIRECTOR SMITH
Professor, what you've discovered must remain classified.

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
You can't be serious! This could rewrite history!

DIRECTOR SMITH
(firm)
That's exactly why it must stay buried.

PROFESSOR HAWTHORNE
(standing, angry)
This is censorship!

DIRECTOR SMITH
(calmly)
This is national security.

Guards enter the room.

DIRECTOR SMITH (CONT'D)
(to guards)
Escort the Professor and his assistant out.

MATCH CUT TO:

INT. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY - DAY (PRESENT)

The same library, but dustier. DAVID (30s, determined) stands where Professor Hawthorne once stood.

DAVID (V.O.)
Three years ago, Professor Hawthorne disappeared. His research vanished with him.

David pulls the same book from the shelf. It falls open to a page with handwritten notes in the margin.

DAVID
(reading)
"The truth is hidden in plain sight."

His phone BUZZES. Text message: "They know you're there. Run."

David pockets the book and rushes toward the exit.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - CONTINUOUS

David bursts through the doors. Black SUVs screech to a halt. MEN IN SUITS emerge.

AGENT JONES
(shouting)
Stop right there!

David runs. The agents give chase.

BEGIN MONTAGE - THE CHASE

-- David vaults over a campus wall
-- Agents split up to surround him
-- David ducks into a crowded student cafeteria
-- He exits through the kitchen
-- Agents search the cafeteria
-- David catches a bus just as it's leaving

END MONTAGE

INT. BUS - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

David, breathing heavily, looks back. No one following. He opens the book, finds a USB drive taped inside the cover.

DAVID
(to himself)
What were you hiding, Professor?

An OLD WOMAN next to him leans over.

OLD WOMAN
(whispering)
He said you'd come.

David turns, shocked.

DAVID
You knew Professor Hawthorne?

OLD WOMAN
(smiling mysteriously)
I know many things, young man.
(handing him an envelope)
He left this for whoever was brave enough to continue his work.

The bus stops. The old woman gets off, disappearing into the crowd.

David opens the envelope. Inside: a map and a single key.

DAVID (V.O.)
Every mystery has a key. Sometimes, it's literal.

TIME CUT:

EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

David approaches a rusted door. He tries the key. It fits.

INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

David enters, flashlight in hand. The beam reveals walls covered with Professor Hawthorne's research - photos, maps, ancient texts.

EMMA (O.S.)
I've been waiting for you.

David spins around. Emma steps from the shadows, older, harder.

DAVID
Emma? But you disappeared with the Professor.

EMMA
(sad)
He's dead. They killed him.
(beat)
But his work lives on.

She gestures to the walls.

EMMA (CONT'D)
Everything you need to expose them is here.

DAVID
Why didn't youâ€”

EMMA
(interrupting)
Because I was waiting for someone they wouldn't suspect. Someone new.
(intense)
Will you finish what he started?

David looks at the research, then back at Emma.

DAVID
(determined)
Yes.

EMMA
Then we begin tonight.

FADE TO BLACK.
